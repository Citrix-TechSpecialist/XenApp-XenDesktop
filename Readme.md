XenDesktop is a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) which allows users to virtually access and run Microsoft Windows and Linux desktops from a datacenter or a public or private cloud, via devices located anywhere. Users are able to access virtual desktops and applications through XenApp using a locally installed client called Citrix Receiver. Virtual applications are delivered and managed via XenApp and virtual desktops are delivered and managed via XenDesktop.
